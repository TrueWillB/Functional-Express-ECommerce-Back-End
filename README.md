## Description

### Video Walkthrough URL: https://youtu.be/GrRS6RE7pW8

This is a simple back end for an ecommerce website. It gives the ability to add categories, products, and tags to an ecommerce site

## Installation

To run this app, you will need a client to send raw http fetch requests. I used Insomnia while developing this app. In order to install the app, download the repo, use the provided schema in the db folder to create a SQL database, and run node seeds/index.js if you desire to seed the database with data for testing. Run the server using node server.js

## Usage

This app can be used to keep track of and provide data to a front end for ecommerce purposes. Because this is just a back end, the data will not be formatted in a pretty, human-readable way. It is designed to be easily deployable to support the user's front end
